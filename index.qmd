## üåø Ecological Thinking for Everyday Life

In a world that feels increasingly complex, finding balance and clarity can feel like a challenge. What if there was a way to design your life with the same care and intention found in nature's ecosystems?

Ecological thinking offers a framework for creating systems that work for you‚Äîwhether in your relationships, work, or personal growth. It‚Äôs about fostering resilience, sustainability, and balance by learning from the patterns and principles of the natural world.

This open resource is an invitation to explore these ideas and apply them in practical, meaningful ways. Together, we‚Äôll discover how thoughtful, nature-inspired design can help you navigate life‚Äôs complexities with creativity and intention.

### **üêö What This Is**

This is a resource for rethinking challenges and opportunities in everyday life through the lens of permaculture principles.

-   **Observe** to uncover patterns in your life.

-   **Harness your time, energy, and resources** to create systems that last.

-   Explore how valuing **diversity and small, thoughtful solutions** can help you navigate complexity with clarity.

In the resource, we walk through each permaculture principle to ask ourselves better questions about how might live a more engaged and integrated life. For example:

-   **Design from Patterns to Details**: Start with the big picture and refine your plan as you go.

-   **Use and Value Diversity**: Strengthen your systems by incorporating multiple perspectives.

-   **Creatively Use and Respond to Change**: Turn challenges into opportunities with flexibility and resilience.

## üåæ **Experiential Online Workshops**

In 2025, I‚Äôll be hosting a series of collaborative workshops to explore permaculture principles and how they might relate to our daily life ‚Äîone principle each month.

These workshops are:

-   **Open and Generative**: Each session is an opportunity to reflect on the principles, connect with others, and explore how these ideas might fit into your life.

-   **Safe and Inclusive**: Workshops will follow a clear code of conduct to ensure everyone feels welcome and respected.

-   **Flexible and Collaborative**: Join us for the full year, or attend individual sessions based on your interest and schedule.

Each month, we‚Äôll focus on one of the 12 permaculture principles, offering space for discussion, personal reflection, and practical application. Together, we‚Äôll discern how these principles can guide you to design systems that work for you.

Participants will have the chance to contribute their own ideas and resources, making this an engaging and exploratory process.

### **Who It‚Äôs For** 

This series of experiential online workshops is designed for anyone who is curious about applying ecological principles to their everyday life. Together we'll seek ways to navigate life's complexities with creativity, balance, and connection via inspiration from the natural world.
