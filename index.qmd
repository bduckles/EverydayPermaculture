## üåø Rethinking Daily Life with Ecological Principles

In a world that feels increasingly complex, finding balance and clarity can feel like a challenge. What if there was a way to design your life with the same care and intention found in nature's ecosystems?

Ecological thinking offers a framework for creating systems that work for you‚Äîwhether in your relationships, work, or personal growth. It‚Äôs about fostering resilience, sustainability, and balance by learning from the patterns and principles of the natural world.

This open resource is an invitation to explore these ideas and apply them in practical, meaningful ways. Together, we‚Äôll discover how thoughtful, nature-inspired design can help you navigate life‚Äôs complexities with creativity and intention.

### **üêö What This Resource Is**

This is a resource for rethinking challenges and opportunities in everyday life through the lens of ecological principles.

-   **Observe** to uncover patterns in your life.

-   **Harness your time, energy, and resources** to create systems that last.

-   Explore how valuing **diversity and small, thoughtful solutions** can help you navigate complexity with clarity.

The resource walks through each permaculture principle to ask ourselves better questions about how might live a more engaged and integrated life. For example:

-   **Design from Patterns to Details**: Start with the big picture and refine your plan as you go.

-   **Use and Value Diversity**: Strengthen your systems by incorporating multiple perspectives.

-   **Creatively Use and Respond to Change**: Turn challenges into opportunities with flexibility and resilience.

This resource is a work in progress and will be updated and shifted as we go. If you have suggestions, links or other resources to share, we'd love to include them. 

## üåæ **2025 Online Workshops**

In 2025, I have been hosting a series of collaborative workshops to explore these principles and how they might relate to our daily life. We work through one principle each month.

These workshops are:

-   **Open and Generative**: Each session is an opportunity to reflect on the principles, connect with others, and explore how these ideas might fit into your life.

-   **Safe and Inclusive**: Workshops will follow a clear code of conduct to ensure everyone feels welcome and respected.

-   **Flexible and Collaborative**: Join us for the full year, or attend individual sessions based on your interest and schedule.

Each month, we‚Äôll focus on one of the 12 permaculture principles, offering space for discussion, personal reflection, and practical application. Together, we‚Äôll discern how these principles can guide you to design systems that work for you.

Participants will have the chance to contribute their own ideas and resources, making this an engaging and exploratory process.

### üë• **Who It‚Äôs For**

This series of experiential online workshops is designed for anyone who is curious about applying ecological principles to their everyday life. Together we'll seek ways to navigate life's complexities with creativity, balance, and connection via inspiration from the natural world.

Who might be interested?

-   **Professionals** navigating transitions or looking to bring fresh perspectives to their work.

## ‚ùì**FAQ**

-   **Will the workshops be recorded?**

The workshops are designed for interaction, including discussions and solo time for personal reflection, so they won‚Äôt be recorded to maintain a comfortable and open environment.

-   **I don't know if I can make it, but I really want to hear more.**

[Sign up for my list serve](bethduckles.substack.com) and I'll update you with thoughts and ideas related to these topics. 

-   **What kind of experience will this be?**

The workshops will take place on Zoom, with a shared Google document to collect and exchange resources during the session. At the start of each workshop, I‚Äôll share a code of conduct and a few guiding principles to set the tone for our time together.

I‚Äôll introduce content inspired by the Everyday Flourishing resource, and we‚Äôll engage in activities to explore how these ideas apply to our daily lives. I encourage you to bring along a journal or use a notes app to capture thoughts and reflections just for yourself. This will be a space to pause, reflect, and engage with the material in a way that feels meaningful to you.

We‚Äôll also have opportunities to connect and learn from one another. I approach these workshops with a spirit of co-creation‚Äîrecognizing that we‚Äôre all here to grow, share, and learn together. You can explore what resonates most with you and leave what doesn't work for you. Everything is by invitation.
