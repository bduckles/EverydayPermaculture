# Introduction

Permaculture is one of those topics I’ve admired from afar but felt intimidated by. I imagine folks well-versed in those practices having beautiful lush gardens with verdant leaves and frolicking butterflies. My own approach to gardening is to throw things into my box and see what I can keep alive (and away from the squirrels).  

Still, when a friend of mine talked about using the [twelve permaculture principles](https://permacultureprinciples.com/) as a way to think about her life it got me thinking. Could I do that? What would it mean to think about the ecological system of my everyday life? 

What appeals to me is that permaculture takes seriously the fact that we as humans are embedded in an ecosystem. If we change one thing, it changes other things. 

## What could permaculture teach me?

The idea stuck with me. I might not be a very successful gardener, but I do like thinking in ecological ways. It's not just about driving a Prius or enthusiastically recycling. 

**I just like being in nature.** I like trees, ferns, rivers, ocean and mountains. I find metaphors from nature to be powerfully motivating. 

When I think about the complexities of my life as an ecosystem, or a garden or a forest I gain so much more than if I think of lists of tasks, priorities or goals.

I’m [wary of productivity](https://www.dukeupress.edu/counterproductive) as it is used in the modern world. I don't know that I always agree that what other people think is productive is really creating what I want more of in the world. 

What follows are some musing about each of the twelve permaculture principles followed by questions you might consider and reflect on as you consider your own life.
