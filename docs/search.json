    "text": "A few years ago, a friend mentioned that she used the twelve permaculture principles as a way to think about her life. That idea stuck with me. What would it mean to see my life as an ecosystem—to approach it with the same care, curiosity, and creativity that permaculture brings to gardening? I wrote a blog post about it and a few folks read it.\nThe ideas behind permaculture keep resurfacing for me, especially in these times of fear, challenge, and change. We’re facing a confluence of crises—climate change, political polarization, the lingering impacts of the pandemic, rising loneliness, mental health challenges, and fraying community connections. I find myself drawn to the wisdom of the natural world when looking at such challenges. What can it teach us about resilience, adaptability, and how to create systems that nurture and sustain us?\nThis site is my way of exploring those questions and inviting us to think differently about the choices we make. It’s an attempt to consider how we might live in greater alignment with the interconnected systems around us—how we can tend to the ecosystems of our lives: our relationships, work, dreams, and communities. How can we contend with and create systems that to meaningfully support ourselves, creating systems of balance and accountability while doing the hard work of responding to the deep challenges of our time?\nWritten by Beth M.

    "text": "🥕 Isn’t Permaculture About Gardening?\nIt was my mother who was the exceptional gardener in our family. She had an intuitive knack for plants, patiently figuring out what they needed—whether it was the right light, water, or nutrients. She didn’t hesitate to dig things up when they were in the wrong spot or plant things when the timing was right. Even indoor plants thrived under her care, often nursed back to health with quiet persistence when something went wrong.\nI didn’t inherit her green thumb. I’m not a terrible gardener, but I lack the natural instinct she seemed to have. I consider myself more of a lazy gardener—experimenting when I have energy, rarely understanding why something works or doesn’t, but always delighted when it does.\nStill, I love nature. Its metaphors are endlessly inspiring, offering insights that shape my thinking and work. Even if I can’t keep the bugs from eating holes in my kale, I’ve learned that nature offers wisdom beyond the garden. It teaches patience, adaptation, and resilience—qualities that feel increasingly vital in a world that often demands relentless productivity."

    "text": "🌊 How to Be Right Now\nTruthfully, modern productivity models have long felt at odds with my experience. I’ve struggled to fit myself into rigid structures of task lists, priorities, and goals. These days, I’m finding inspiration in voices like Oliver Burkeman and Jenny Odell, who advocate for alternatives to productivity culture. Their ideas resonate because they feel more aligned with how life unfolds for me—messy, interconnected, unpredictable and sometimes beautiful.\nI’m inspired by work by adrienne maree brown and Norma Wong and others. These are folks who ask us to remember the natural world as we do our human work, who speak to us in times of challenge and who invite us to consider our humanity as a part of nature.\nWhen I think of my life as an ecosystem—a garden or forest—it shifts my perspective. Viewing life in this way feels expansive and generative, offering more clarity and growth than simply focusing on tasks to check off. It’s a lens that invites abundance, creativity, and experimentation. I appreciate the way permaculture mirrors the systems of nature, teaching us how to live with attention to the systems we create."

    "text": "💮 About the Principle\nIn permaculture, success is not just about an individual plant but the relationships it forms with the plants and environment around it. A skilled practitioner considers how each element interacts with others—what supports its growth and how it contributes in return. For example, a plant might flourish when paired with a companion plant that repels pests or enriches the soil. The question is not just what to plant, but where and with what.\nThe same question applies to our own lives: What do we need to be around to flourish? What kinds of relationships and systems enable us to thrive? When we step back and view ourselves as part of a larger system, we can begin to understand the connections that sustain us.\nAs social creatures, humans are inherently interconnected, yet modern life often leaves us feeling isolated, disconnected, or even at odds with one another. This principle encourages us to reflect on our relationships and communities:\n\nHow do we build meaningful connections?\nHow can we integrate ourselves into supportive systems, fostering collaboration and mutual growth?\n\nUltimately, this principle invites us to see relationships not as isolated or transactional but as part of an integrated whole where we support one another and thrive together.",

Adapting to an evolving world is not only constant, it is a natural part of being in the world.. While change often feels uncomfortable, it’s not inherently bad. In fact, it opens the door for growth, creativity, and resilience.\nI love the framing from Oldster, a publication that invites people of all ages to reflect on the idea that “we are all as old as we’ve ever been.” This perspective normalizes change as something universal and inclusive, allowing us to embrace where we are in life without fear of what’s ahead.\nIn our lives, there are many ways we are already changing—our bodies, our relationships, our surroundings.

    "section": "🗑️ About the Principle",
    "text": "🗑️ About the Principle\nThink of a “closed-loop” system as similar to a dome on Mars or the Moon. Inside the dome, everything must stay within the system, meaning waste can’t just be discarded—it has to serve a purpose. If waste isn’t transformed into something useful, the dome would soon overflow with things we don’t want or need.\nThis principle challenges us to rethink waste as something valuable. For example, manure, though it’s excrement, is a remarkable fertilizer that nourishes gardens. It’s not considered waste because it contributes to the growth of something else. Similarly, William McDonough’s Cradle to Cradle approach to manufacturing suggests that waste isn’t inherently bad—it can be repurposed as a raw material for something new.\nAt its core, this principle asks us to reconsider the concept of waste entirely. It suggests we see all that we create, produce, or discard as having the potential for utility. In our own lives, it invites us to examine where we might be wasting time, energy, or resources, and to reimagine those “wastes” as opportunities or places for us to find .\n\n🌱 No Waste in Your Life\n\nWhere do I feel like I’m wasting time, energy, or money? How might I reframe that? For example:\n\nStaring out the window might initially feel like wasted time, but it could be seen as a moment for imagination or reflection, perhaps inviting us towards more creative expression.\nOverexertion might feel like wasted energy but could teach us about our limits and resilience.\nUnplanned expenses might seem wasteful but could represent opportunities for money to flow into new areas or benefit others.\n\nWhat is truly wasteful, and what is something I might not like (such as weeds) but that serves a purpose in the broader system?\nWhat piles up in my life—clutter, unread emails, unfinished projects? What do I lose or forget to care for? What could be maintained or repurposed with more attention?\nWhat would it look like to focus on maintaining and valuing the things I already possess, whether physical objects, relationships, or personal skills?",

    "text": "🏔️ About the Principle\nThis principle focuses on the intersections and boundaries in our lives—those places where different systems, ideas, or experiences meet. In a garden, edges are the spaces where a path meets a planting bed, where sunlight meets shade, or where one plant grows beside another. These areas are often the most diverse and fertile because they blend elements from both sides. In biology, edge ecosystems—like the borders of forests and grasslands or where rivers meet the sea—are some of the most productive and biodiverse places on Earth.\nIn our personal lives, the “edges” can be times of transition or spaces where routines or boundaries shift. For instance, the commute between home and work can be a time of reflection or creativity. Similarly, stepping outside your comfort zone or engaging with people or ideas different from your own can be an opportunity for growth and innovation.\nThis principle also invites us to think about marginalization in society—of people, places, or experiences. Who or what gets overlooked? Are there voices in our community that go unheard? Are there parts of ourselves that we push to the margins? By valuing these “margins,” we can unlock creativity, insight, and new ways of thinking.",

For instance, I may not be someone who can easily sustain high-intensity physical activities like triathlons, but I thrive when engaging in creative, tactile activities like knitting sweaters or cooking jam. These pursuits leave me feeling energized and fulfilled rather than drained.\nIn environmental terms, it’s about recognizing the renewable resources available in our surroundings and using them thoughtfully. For example, living in the Pacific Northwest, I have access to abundant rain, thriving ferns, and a wealth of pine needles. These natural resources can inspire sustainable practices like collecting rainwater, using natural mulch, or foraging for crafts and projects.\nThis principle asks us to evaluate what is naturally replenishable in our lives—both internally and externally—and to lean into those resources to create systems that are not just sustainable but regenerative.

In the fall, trees shed their leaves, conserve energy in the winter and then bud and flower in the spring. Animals behave differently too, from hoarding food to hibernation in the winter.\nPredators Watching Prey - Animals that rely on other animals as food or who are seen as food are likely to know instinctively how to respond to the movements of another animal.\nPhototropism - Plants “watch” for the light and grow towards it. Consider a field of sunflowers that follows the sun, or trees that reach higher to get more light for their leaves.\nMigration - Animals that move based on the temperature, light and food availability are responding to the things they sense and experience in their world.\nWeather - We could think of weather patterns as responding to the environmental conditions such as temperature, wind patterns or humidity to make clouds or move storms.",

This way, you’ll receive the email invitations for each workshop and stay in the loop.\nIf there’s enough interest, I may consider adding an additional day or time.\n\nWhat kind of experience will this be?\n\nThe workshops will take place on Zoom, with a shared Google document to collect and exchange resources during the session. At the start of each workshop, I’ll share a code of conduct and a few guiding principles to set the tone for our time together.\nI’ll introduce content inspired by the Everyday Flourishing resource, and we’ll engage in activities to explore how these ideas apply to our daily lives. I encourage you to bring along a journal or use a notes app to capture thoughts and reflections just for yourself. This will be a space to pause, reflect, and engage with the material in a way that feels meaningful to you.\nWe’ll also have opportunities to connect and learn from one another. I approach these workshops with a spirit of co-creation—recognizing that we’re all here to grow, share, and learn together. You can explore what resonates most with you and leave what doesn’t work for you. Everything is by invitation.\n\nWho is leading this?\n\nHi! I’m Beth Duckles.

    "text": "🧺 About the Principle\nThis principle suggests that what we grow and cultivate in our lives should offer us a yield or a benefit and that we should set ourselves up so that the things we do have multiple and perhaps even multiplicative benefits. This principle is as much about looking for the benefits as it is about making sure that the benefits are there for all.\nI’ve heard that some people who are devoted to permaculture will only grow things in their gardens that have multiple uses. For instance, one might grow bamboo which offers a variety of yields: it creates shade, it’s a privacy fence, it stops water from flowing down a hill and it can be used to make things.\nWhat I appreciate about this way of thinking is that it offers us a variety of ways to consider benefits in doing what we do. For example, we might look at the work we do and think mostly of its benefits in terms of money, status or health insurance. But using this principle asks us to broaden the benefit of doing this job to consider more things. Does this job offer me a sense of meaning? The ability to be in relationship with people I enjoy? The capacity to learn new things? The capacity to provide for my family?",

    "text": "🐌 About the Principle\nOne of my favorite Aikido teachers, the late Wendy Palmer Sensei, often spoke about our society’s complicated relationship with small, incremental changes. She pointed out that we might object loudly to a 2% tax increase, yet dismiss a 2% improvement in compassion or mindfulness as insignificant.\nThis principle invites us to rethink that mindset. Instead of rushing to create big, sweeping changes, it asks us to consider the power of small, deliberate shifts. These smaller changes can lead to profound and lasting improvements in our lives.\nThis idea runs counter to the dominant culture in much of the Western world, which celebrates dramatic transformations: losing 100 pounds, doubling profits, or achieving overnight success. I would suggest that those changes are often unsustainable and short-lived. Small changes—integrated gradually—are easier to maintain and more likely to become permanent parts of our lives.\nThis principle reminds us that sustainable progress doesn’t have to be flashy. It’s found in small steps, repeated over time, that create meaningful and lasting transformation.",

If we were to consider what kind of aesthetic the natural world has, we’d see things like fractals, spirals, waves, tessellations, meanders, bubbles, cracks, spots and stripes. We might also see the pattern alphabets in our natural worlds and notice that shapes continue in a wide variety of places.\nThese patterns are so fundamental as to be almost invisible to us. We see them everywhere, and yet we do not turn to them as often as we might to consider how to live our lives.\nWhat might these patterns give us or inspire for us if we were to think about them in our everyday life?How can we learn from the patterns in nature and apply them to our lives?

Am I respecting these rhythms?\nHow can I cultivate more harmony in areas that feel chaotic or disconnected?\nWhat metaphors and processes in the natural world am I drawn to right now?\n\nDo I feel drawn to an action a certain animal makes? The patterns of leaves? The way that a river flows? A flower, shrub or herb? Webs? Spirals? Fractals?\nWhat is it about these natural elements that appeal to me? What does it teach me?\n\nDoes nature deal with some version of a problem or a challenge I face? If so, how does the natural world respond?\n\nFor example if there have been big disruptions in my life, such as a divorce or a death in the family, how might these be compared to nature recovering from a forest fire or a hurricane?",
