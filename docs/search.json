    "text": "Use Natural Patterns and Apply them to Design\nThis principle asks us to use nature as our teacher and to consider the patterns we see repeated in natural systems as ways to rethink the life we lead. This might lead us to consider how can we learn from the patterns in nature and apply them to the problems we face.\n\nWhat metaphors and processes in the natural world are interesting to me? Do I feel drawn to an action a certain animal makes? The way that a tree interacts in the woods? A flower, shrub or herb? What is it about these natural elements that appeal to me? What does it teach me?\nDoes nature deal with some version of a problem or a challenge I face? If so, how does the natural world respond?\nConsider the four elements — earth, water, wind and fire. Which of these is most resonant in my life right now? What might that element teach me?",

    "text": "Use local resources and create sustainable options.\nI heard a teacher talk once about how we have a complicated attitude towards small incremental changes in our lives. On the one hand, we would scream and yell if we were asked to pay 2% more taxes each year. Yet we think that it’s not much change at all if we manage to be 2% more compassionate, or 2% more thoughtful about money.\nInstead of rushing to create lots of change, this principle asks us to consider what small shifts will create a better life for ourselves. \nIt’s important to be aware that this principle is quite counter to the dominant western culture which celebrates big sweeping changes (lost 100 pounds, 50% increase in fourth quarter profits). \nYet small changes are so much easier to sustain than the big sweeping changes. We’re able to build them into our lives and they actually last.\n\nHow can we find the smallest possible solution to create change? How can we take small, sustainable shifts towards the things that matter most to us?\nWhere can I do something minor such as moving a piece of furniture, or adjusting where a tool is stored that would make my life easier?\nWhere would a slow change be easier to accept than a fast one?\nWhere would patient attention be beneficial to the people in my life?\nWhat would I like 2% more of in my life?",

    "text": "This principle suggests that what we grow and cultivate in our lives should offer us a yield or a benefit. I’ve heard for instance that some people who are devoted to permaculture will only grow things in their gardens that have multiple uses such as bamboo which offers a variety of yields: it creates shade, it’s a privacy fence, it stops water from flowing down a hill and it can be used to make things.\nI find it compelling to think about what my work, time and energy has yielded. We may go to work so that we can get paid, but we may yield more than just money from that work. Perhaps we also get a sense of purpose, a community of like-minded individuals, a sense of well being and accomplishment. You might trade those things for less yields in other parts of your life such as free time or the capacity to travel. \n\nWhat is it that I have an easy time creating? What do I have a LOT of?\nOf the things that I have a lot of, which of those things am I glad I have an abundance of?\nOf the things that I have a lot of, what would I prefer to have less of?\nWhat is it that I struggle to cultivate? What do I not have enough of?\nWhat do I not cultivate that I’m glad to keep out of my life?",

I find metaphors from nature to be powerfully motivating. \nWhen I think about the complexities of my life as an ecosystem, or a garden or a forest I gain so much more than if I think of lists of tasks, priorities or goals.\nI’m wary of productivity as it is used in the modern world.

While I could do something like running a marathon, that task would not be renewable for me. I’d be in a lot of pain afterwards. It would take me a lot more resources to run a marathon than someone who loves running and has learned how to run long distances.\nWhen we consider ourselves as resources, I find it fascinating to think about what we have and do that is renewable for us — just because we slept. While I’m not a runner, I have skills as someone who likes to make things such as knitting sweaters or cooking up jam. \nWe might also consider the environmental resources that are renewable in our lives. For instance, as someone who lives in the pacific northwest, I have access to quite a lot of rain, ferns and pine needles. \n\nWhat skills do I have in abundance?
