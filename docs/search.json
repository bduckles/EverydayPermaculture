    "text": "üï∏Ô∏è About the Principle\n\nUse Natural Patterns and Apply them to Design\nThis principle asks us to use nature as our teacher and to consider the patterns we see repeated in natural systems. If we were to consider what kind of aesthetic the natural world has, we‚Äôd see things like fractals, spirals, waves, tessellations, meanders, bubbles, cracks, spots and stripes. We might also see the pattern alphabets in our natural worlds and notice that shapes continue in a wide variety of places.\nThese patterns are so fundamental as to be almost invisible to us. We see them everywhere, and yet we do not turn to them as often as we might to consider how to live our lives.\nWhat might these patterns give us or inspire for us if we were to think about them in our everyday life?How can we learn from the patterns in nature and apply them to our lives? If we were to see our challenges as an organization as part of a meander or as a wave, how might this change our perception of finding the next right step?",

    "text": "üêå About the Principle\nOne of my favorite Aikido teachers, the late Wendy Palmer Sensei, often spoke about our society‚Äôs complicated relationship with small, incremental changes. She pointed out that we might object loudly to a 2% tax increase, yet dismiss a 2% improvement in compassion or mindfulness as insignificant.\nThis principle invites us to rethink that mindset. Instead of rushing to create big, sweeping changes, it asks us to consider the power of small, deliberate shifts. These smaller changes can lead to profound and lasting improvements in our lives.\nThis idea runs counter to the dominant culture in much of the Western world, which celebrates dramatic transformations: losing 100 pounds, doubling profits, or achieving overnight success. I would suggest that those changes are often unsustainable and short-lived. Small changes‚Äîintegrated gradually‚Äîare easier to maintain and more likely to become permanent parts of our lives.\nThis principle reminds us that sustainable progress doesn‚Äôt have to be flashy. It‚Äôs found in small steps, repeated over time, that create meaningful and lasting transformation.",

    "text": "üß∫ About the Principle\nThis principle suggests that what we grow and cultivate in our lives should offer us a yield or a benefit and that we should set ourselves up so that the things we do have multiple and perhaps even multiplicative benefits. This principle is as much about looking for the benefits as it is about making sure that the benefits are there for all.\nI‚Äôve heard that some people who are devoted to permaculture will only grow things in their gardens that have multiple uses. For instance, one might grow bamboo which offers a variety of yields: it creates shade, it‚Äôs a privacy fence, it stops water from flowing down a hill and it can be used to make things.\nWhat I appreciate about this way of thinking is that it offers us a variety of ways to consider benefits in doing what we do. For example, we might look at the work we do and think mostly of its benefits in terms of money, status or health insurance. But using this principle asks us to broaden the benefit of doing this job to consider more things. Does this job offer me a sense of meaning? The ability to be in relationship with people I enjoy? The capacity to learn new things? The capacity to provide for my family?",

    "text": "Isn‚Äôt Permaculture Just About Gardening?\nIt was my mother who was the exceptional gardener in our family. She had an intuitive knack for plants, patiently figuring out what they needed‚Äîwhether it was the right light, water, or nutrients. She didn‚Äôt hesitate to dig things up when they were in the wrong spot or plant things when the timing was right. Even indoor plants thrived under her care, often nursed back to health with quiet persistence when something went wrong.\nI didn‚Äôt inherit her green thumb. I‚Äôm not a terrible gardener, but I lack the natural instinct she seemed to have. I consider myself more of a lazy gardener‚Äîexperimenting when I have energy, rarely understanding why something works or doesn‚Äôt, but always delighted when it does.\nStill, I love nature. Its metaphors are endlessly inspiring, offering insights that shape my thinking and work. Even if I can‚Äôt keep the bugs from eating holes in my kale, I‚Äôve learned that nature offers wisdom beyond the garden. It teaches patience, adaptation, and resilience‚Äîqualities that feel increasingly vital in a world that often demands relentless productivity.\nModern productivity models have long felt at odds with my experience. I‚Äôve struggled to fit myself into rigid structures of task lists, priorities, and goals. These days, I‚Äôm finding inspiration in voices like Oliver Burkeman and Jenny Odell, who advocate for alternatives to productivity culture. Their ideas resonate because they feel more aligned with how life unfolds for me‚Äîmessy, interconnected, and unpredictable.\nWhen I think of my life as an ecosystem‚Äîa garden or forest‚Äîit shifts my perspective. Viewing life in this way feels expansive and generative, offering more clarity and growth than simply focusing on tasks to check off. It‚Äôs a lens that invites abundance, creativity, and experimentation. I appreciate the way permaculture mirrors the systems of nature, teaching us how to live with attention to the systems we create."

It asks us to watch what we do and how we interact with others without judgement before we take any action.\nThis calls us to investigate what actually occurs in our life instead of what we imagine should happen. It can be eye opening\nThis is sometimes hard to do in our own life because it‚Äôs like trying to tickle ourselves. How can we see ourselves and notice what is happening in our daily life?\nA few ways to think about it occur to me. First is that we can look at what we complain about. When we complain or have feelings of annoyance or anxiety it can often mean there‚Äôs something that is meaningful to us. If we listen to what is behind the complaint, it might help us to determine what it is that we really want.\nWe might also consider asking others to help us with this task. What do THEY see when they come into our spaces, or ask us about our lives? How might we ask others to help us see our lives more fully? What do they notice when they walk into the garden that is our daily life? What mood do they find us in? What do they see in our appearance? Our areas of interest?",

In the fall, trees shed their leaves, conserve energy in the winter and then bud and flower in the spring. Animals behave differently too, from hoarding food to hibernation in the winter.\nPredators Watching Prey - Animals that rely on other animals as food or who are seen as food are likely to know instinctively how to respond to the movements of another animal.\nPhototropism - Plants ‚Äúwatch‚Äù for the light and grow towards it. Consider a field of sunflowers that follows the sun, or trees that reach higher to get more light for their leaves.\nMigration - Animals that move based on the temperature, light and food availability are responding to the things they sense and experience in their world.\nWeather - We could think of weather patterns as responding to the environmental conditions such as temperature, wind patterns or humidity to make clouds or move storms.",

For instance, I may not be someone who can easily sustain high-intensity physical activities like triathlons, but I thrive when engaging in creative, tactile activities like knitting sweaters or cooking jam. These pursuits leave me feeling energized and fulfilled rather than drained.\nIn environmental terms, it‚Äôs about recognizing the renewable resources available in our surroundings and using them thoughtfully. For example, living in the Pacific Northwest, I have access to abundant rain, thriving ferns, and a wealth of pine needles. These natural resources can inspire sustainable practices like collecting rainwater, using natural mulch, or foraging for crafts and projects.\nThis principle asks us to evaluate what is naturally replenishable in our lives‚Äîboth internally and externally‚Äîand to lean into those resources to create systems that are not just sustainable but regenerative.

These areas are often the most diverse and fertile because they blend elements from both sides.

Inside the dome, everything must stay within the system, meaning waste can‚Äôt just be discarded‚Äîit has to serve a purpose. If waste isn‚Äôt transformed into something useful, the dome would soon overflow with things we don‚Äôt want or need.\nThis principle challenges us to rethink waste as something valuable. For example, manure, though it‚Äôs excrement, is a remarkable fertilizer that nourishes gardens. It‚Äôs not considered waste because it contributes to the growth of something else. Similarly, William McDonough‚Äôs Cradle to Cradle approach to manufacturing suggests that waste isn‚Äôt inherently bad‚Äîit can be repurposed as a raw material for something new.\nAt its core, this principle asks us to reconsider the concept of waste entirely. It suggests we see all that we create, produce, or discard as having the potential for utility. In our own lives, it invites us to examine where we might be wasting time, energy, or resources, and to reimagine those ‚Äúwastes‚Äù as opportunities or places for us to find .\n\nNo Waste in Your Life\n\nWhere do I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time, energy, or money? How might I reframe that? For example:\n\nStaring out the window might initially feel like wasted time, but it could be seen as a moment for imagination or reflection, perhaps inviting us towards more creative expression.\nOverexertion might feel like wasted energy but could teach us about our limits and resilience.\nUnplanned expenses might seem wasteful but could represent opportunities for money to flow into new areas or benefit others.\n\nWhat is truly wasteful, and what is something I might not like (such as weeds) but that serves a purpose in the broader system?\nWhat piles up in my life‚Äîclutter, unread emails, unfinished projects? What do I lose or forget to care for? What could be maintained or repurposed with more attention?\nWhat would it look like to focus on maintaining and valuing the things I already possess, whether physical objects, relationships, or personal skills?",

If one crop fails due to disease or a natural event damages part of the system, a diverse ecosystem ensures that others can fill the gap and maintain the system‚Äôs balance. Diversity doesn‚Äôt just enhance survival‚Äîit fosters growth, innovation, and long-term sustainability.\nThis principle invites us to think about where we may be stuck in repetition‚Äîtalking to the same people, engaging in the same habits, or maintaining a single mindset. It encourages us to seek out and value diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences in our lives and communities. By embracing diversity, we can enrich our own understanding, increase adaptability, and build stronger connections.",

Adapting to an evolving world is not only constant, it is a natural part of being in the world.. While change often feels uncomfortable, it‚Äôs not inherently bad. In fact, it opens the door for growth, creativity, and resilience.\nI love the framing from Oldster, a publication that invites people of all ages to reflect on the idea that ‚Äúwe are all as old as we‚Äôve ever been.‚Äù This perspective normalizes change as something universal and inclusive, allowing us to embrace where we are in life without fear of what‚Äôs ahead.\nIn our lives, there are many ways we are already changing‚Äîour bodies, our relationships, our surroundings. This principle encourages us to meet those changes with flexibility and creativity, cultivating a mindset that sees opportunity and possibility in every shift.",

    "text": "üíÆ About the Principle\nIn permaculture, success is not just about an individual plant but the relationships it forms with the plants and environment around it. A skilled practitioner considers how each element interacts with others‚Äîwhat supports its growth and how it contributes in return. For example, a plant might flourish when paired with a companion plant that repels pests or enriches the soil. The question is not just what to plant, but where and with what.\nThe same question applies to our own lives: What do we need to be around to flourish? What kinds of relationships and systems enable us to thrive? When we step back and view ourselves as part of a larger system, we can begin to understand the connections that sustain us.\nAs social creatures, humans are inherently interconnected, yet modern life often leaves us feeling isolated, disconnected, or even at odds with one another. This principle encourages us to reflect on our relationships and communities:\n\nHow do we build meaningful connections?\nHow can we integrate ourselves into supportive systems, fostering collaboration and mutual growth?\n\nUltimately, this principle invites us to see relationships not as isolated or transactional but as part of an integrated whole where we support one another and thrive together.",
