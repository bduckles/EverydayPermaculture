    "text": "🧺 About the Principle\nThis principle suggests that what we grow and cultivate in our lives should offer us a yield or a benefit and that we should set ourselves up so that the things we do have multiple and perhaps even multiplicative benefits. This principle is as much about looking for the benefits as it is about making sure that the benefits are there for all.\nI’ve heard that some people who are devoted to permaculture will only grow things in their gardens that have multiple uses. For instance, one might grow bamboo which offers a variety of yields: it creates shade, it’s a privacy fence, it stops water from flowing down a hill and it can be used to make things.\nWhat I appreciate about this way of thinking is that it offers us a variety of ways to consider benefits in doing what we do. For example, we might look at the work we do and think mostly of its benefits in terms of money, status or health insurance. But using this principle asks us to broaden the benefit of doing this job to consider more things. Does this job offer me a sense of meaning? The ability to be in relationship with people I enjoy? The capacity to learn new things? The capacity to provide for my family?",

    "section": "Isn’t Permaculture Just About Gardening?",
    "text": "Isn’t Permaculture Just About Gardening?\nIt was my mother who was the exceptional gardener in our family. She had an intuitive knack for plants, patiently figuring out what they needed—whether it was the right light, water, or nutrients. She didn’t hesitate to dig things up when they were in the wrong spot or plant seeds when the timing was right. Even her indoor plants thrived under her care, often nursed back to health with quiet persistence when something went wrong.\nI didn’t inherit her green thumb. I’m not a terrible gardener, but I lack the natural instinct she seemed to have. I consider myself more of a lazy gardener—experimenting when I have energy, rarely understanding why something works or doesn’t, but always delighted when it does.\nStill, I love nature. Its metaphors are endlessly inspiring, offering insights that shape my thinking and work. Even if I can’t keep the bugs from eating holes in my kale, I’ve learned that nature offers wisdom beyond the garden. It teaches patience, adaptation, and resilience—qualities that feel increasingly vital in a world that often demands relentless productivity.\nModern productivity models often feel at odds with my experiences. I’ve struggled to fit myself into rigid structures of task lists, priorities, and goals. Instead, I’ve found inspiration in voices like Oliver Burkeman and Jenny Odell, who advocate for alternatives to productivity culture. Their ideas resonate because they feel more aligned with how life unfolds—messy, interconnected, and unpredictable.\nWhen I think of my life as an ecosystem—a garden or forest—it shifts my perspective. Viewing life in this way feels expansive and generative, offering more clarity and growth than simply focusing on tasks to check off. It’s a lens that invites abundance, creativity, and experimentation. I appreciate the way permaculture mirrors the systems of nature, teaching us how to live with attention to the systems we create."

It asks us to watch what we do and how we interact with others without judgement before we take any action.\nThis calls us to investigate what actually occurs in our life instead of what we imagine should happen. It can be eye opening\nThis is sometimes hard to do in our own life because it’s like trying to tickle ourselves. How can we see ourselves and notice what is happening in our daily life?\nA few ways to think about it occur to me. First is that we can look at what we complain about. When we complain or have feelings of annoyance or anxiety it can often mean there’s something that is meaningful to us. If we listen to what is behind the complaint, it might help us to determine what it is that we really want.\nWe might also consider asking others to help us with this task. What do THEY see when they come into our spaces, or ask us about our lives? How might we ask others to help us see our lives more fully? What do they notice when they walk into the garden that is our daily life? What mood do they find us in? What do they see in our appearance? Our areas of interest?",

Animals behave differently too, from hoarding food to hibernation in the winter.\nPredators Watching Prey - Animals that rely on other animals as food or who are seen as food are likely to know instinctively how to respond to the movements of another animal.\nPhototropism - Plants “watch” for the light and grow towards it. Consider a field of sunflowers that follows the sun, or trees that reach higher to get more light for their leaves.\nMigration - Animals that move based on the temperature, light and food availability are responding to the things they sense and experience in their world.\nWeather - We could think of weather patterns as responding to the environmental conditions such as temperature, wind patterns or humidity to make clouds or move storms.",

    "text": "🐴 About the Principle\nThis principle encourages us to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources and instead focus on what is abundant and renewable in our lives—whether it’s from the natural world or within ourselves.\nWhen we think about renewability in personal terms, it’s helpful to consider the activities or resources that restore us naturally without excessive strain. For instance, I may not be someone who can easily sustain high-intensity physical activities like triathlons, but I thrive when engaging in creative, tactile activities like knitting sweaters or cooking jam. These pursuits leave me feeling energized and fulfilled rather than drained.\nIn environmental terms, it’s about recognizing the renewable resources available in our surroundings and using them thoughtfully. For example, living in the Pacific Northwest, I have access to abundant rain, thriving ferns, and a wealth of pine needles. These natural resources can inspire sustainable practices like collecting rainwater, using natural mulch, or foraging for crafts and projects.\nThis principle asks us to evaluate what is naturally replenishable in our lives—both internally and externally—and to lean into those resources to create systems that are not just sustainable but regenerative. It’s about finding ways to",

From canning fruit to putting water in clay pots, to creating beef jerky there are thousands of ways we have learned to store and to save food. We do this as a method of storing energy and saving it for the future.\nSunshine - Have you ever seen a pet move themselves to the sunny spot so that they can nap in the warmth? Or have you. moved your deck chair so that you can feel the sun on your face? We instinctively move towards the sunshine when we see it and have often designed both to shade from and to feel the sunlight in our buildings.\nHoney from Bees - Bees literally create a liquid gold that takes the surplus energy of flowers and turns them into a nutrient dense food. We can use the wax for making candles or skin creams. But the energy found in the honey is drawn from the sunny days the bees spent gathering pollen.\nCacti Storing Water - Cacti in desert locations will store water from the rains in their flesh so that they can survive long times when there is dry weather.\nSeeds - Most seeds are designed to wait until favorable growing conditions come about making sure that they store their energy for the next generation and to ensure survival.",

Waste has to offer something to the rest of the system otherwise we’ll have a dome overflowing with stuff we don’t want.\nThis principle suggests that what we “waste” is something to value. Manure for instance is a remarkable fertilizer and serves a purpose in a garden. We wouldn’t call that waste even though it is excrement. William McDonough’s idea of Cradle to Cradle Manufacturing asks us to think about waste not as something bad, but as something that can be a raw material for something else.\nThis principle seeks to question our modern concept of waste and to suggest that we see all that we create and produce as useful. When we look at our lives and what we spend our time, resources and energy doing things, where are we creating waste?",
