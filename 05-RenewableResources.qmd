### Reducing Dependence on Scarce Resources

Of course this principle focuses on fossil fuels and discourages our dependence on non renewable resources, but I’ve really enjoyed thinking about this in terms of renewability of what is available in my life. While I could do something like running a marathon, that task would not be renewable for me. I’d be in a lot of pain afterwards. It would take me a lot more resources to run a marathon than someone who loves running and has learned how to run long distances.

When we consider ourselves as resources, I find it fascinating to think about what we have and do that is renewable for us — just because we slept. While I’m not a runner, I have skills as someone who likes to make things such as knitting sweaters or cooking up jam. 

We might also consider the environmental resources that are renewable in our lives. For instance, as someone who lives in the pacific northwest, I have access to quite a lot of rain, ferns and pine needles. 

-   What skills do I have in abundance? What am I already good at?

-   In what parts of my life are my passion and enthusiasm abundant?

-   What physical and materials items are easy for me to get?

-   What emotional or spiritual gifts are renewable for me?

-   What in the natural world is abundant where I live? Is this resource renewable?
