#### Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services 

#### *"Make the best use of nature‚Äôs abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources."*

## üê¥ About the Principle

This principle encourages us to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources and instead focus on what is abundant and renewable in our lives‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs from the natural world or within ourselves.

When we think about renewability in personal terms, it‚Äôs helpful to consider the activities or resources that restore us naturally without excessive strain. For instance, I may not be someone who can easily sustain high-intensity physical activities like triathlons, but I thrive when engaging in creative, tactile activities like knitting sweaters or cooking jam. These pursuits leave me feeling energized and fulfilled rather than drained.

In environmental terms, it‚Äôs about recognizing the renewable resources available in our surroundings and using them thoughtfully. For example, living in the Pacific Northwest, I have access to abundant rain, thriving ferns, and a wealth of pine needles. These natural resources can inspire sustainable practices like collecting rainwater, using natural mulch, or foraging for crafts and projects.

This principle asks us to evaluate what is naturally replenishable in our lives‚Äîboth internally and externally‚Äîand to lean into those resources to create systems that are not just sustainable but regenerative. It‚Äôs about finding ways to

## Resources in Your Life

-   What skills do I have in abundance? What am I already good at?

-   In what parts of my life are my passion and enthusiasm abundant?

-   What physical and materials items are easy for me to get?

-   What emotional or spiritual gifts are renewable for me?

## Resources in Your Community

-   What in the natural world is abundant where I live? Is this resource renewable?

    -   What might I do to appreciate and value these resources more?

-   Where is my community gathering to share renewable resources with one another?

    -   Is there a library or tool library nearby?

    -   Where are the community gardens?

-   What cultural traditions exist in my family or my community? How might I learn more?

## Examples in the Natural World 

-   **Soil** - Soil is quite renewable as it can be replenished and built up with microbes and compost

-   **Rainwater Harvesting -** We can collect rain and use it to water plants or for household use.

## Integrating this Principle

-   Consider the places in your community where there is already abundance and work with what is. What do you have a lot of and how can you make use of it?
