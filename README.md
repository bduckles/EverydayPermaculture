# Everyday Permaculture

Author: Beth M. Duckles

Welcome to Everyday Permaculture! ðŸŒ± This resource explores how we can apply permaculture principles to our everyday lives, fostering resilience, care, and reconnection with ecological systems. Inspired by biomimicry, Emergent Strategy, and other frameworks, this project offers reflective questions and practical ideas for living more intentionally with nature and each other.

This repository hosts the static website version of Everyday Permaculture, built using Quarto and hosted on GitHub Pages.
