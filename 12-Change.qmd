## ü¶ã About the Principle

The last principle reminds us that change is a constant and we are going to have to keep responding to an evolving world. Even if we are doing everything ‚Äúright‚Äù there will always be things to adapt to. I find this incredibly inspiring because it reminds us that while change is uncomfortable, it's not a bad thing.

There's a publication called Oldster that allows folks of any age to contribute with the idea that we are all as old as we've ever been. I really enjoy this framing of what it means to get older as it includes us all in the idea of changing and shifting to meet the place that we are living in now.

## Responding to Change in Your Life

There are places where we‚Äôre already changing. As we get older and our loved ones get older too. We can use this principle to cultivate a flexible and creative response to those changes.¬†

-   Where am I facing shifts and changes in my life? Where am I resistant to change? Where am I excited about change?

-   Where can I be more creative and intentional in the things that are shifting in my life? Where can I bring my skills, abilities and resources to bear on what is shifting?

-   In what circumstances is it easy for me to be flexible and to adapt to change? In what circumstances is it harder for me to be flexible and adapt to change?
