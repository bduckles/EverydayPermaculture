This principle is about the intersections and places in your life where things already shift. In a garden, this would be the places where one plant is next to a path or where the fence between your property and someone else’s. Those are the places which are fertile for something different to be created if you pay attention.

In our lives, times where we’re between things or where what we're doing gets put aside. Consider if you bicycle or drive to work, this time where you are not in any particular place, is an in between time. 

We might also consider where in our society we are marginalizing people and experiences or perhaps even marginalizing ourselves. Consider one’s political preferences, place of origin, sexuality, gender identity, work experience, money, race/ethnicity, physical ability, age, attractiveness, skills and more. What does it mean to live in a community where listen to some people but not others?

-   What are the edges in my life that feel most sidelined or neglected?

-   Are there times in my daily life that I could bring more attention to and value more fully?

-   What experiences are marginalized in my community? Who is not being heard?

-   Where am I marginalized? What parts of my identity have I put aside because they are not valued?

-   When do I interact with people who have been in some way marginalized? What does it mean if I do or do not interact with people who are marginalized?
