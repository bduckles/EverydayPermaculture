### Use local resources and create sustainable options.

I heard a teacher talk once about how we have a complicated attitude towards small incremental changes in our lives. On the one hand, we would scream and yell if we were asked to pay 2% more taxes each year. Yet we think that it’s not much change at all if we manage to be 2% more compassionate, or 2% more thoughtful about money.

Instead of rushing to create lots of change, this principle asks us to consider what small shifts will create a better life for ourselves. 

It's important to be aware that this principle is quite counter to the dominant western culture which celebrates big sweeping changes (lost 100 pounds, 50% increase in fourth quarter profits). 

Yet small changes are so much easier to sustain than the big sweeping changes. We’re able to build them into our lives and they actually last.

-   How can we find the smallest possible solution to create change? How can we take small, sustainable shifts towards the things that matter most to us?

-   Where can I do something minor such as moving a piece of furniture, or adjusting where a tool is stored that would make my life easier?

-   Where would a slow change be easier to accept than a fast one?

-   Where would patient attention be beneficial to the people in my life?

-   What would I like 2% more of in my life?
