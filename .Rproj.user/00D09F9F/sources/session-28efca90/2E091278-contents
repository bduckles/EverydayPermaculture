# Introduction

Permaculture is one of those topics I’ve always admired, but often felt intimidated by. While I like gardening, I imagine folks well-versed in permaculture practices having beautiful lush gardens with verdant leaves and frolicking butterflies. My own approach to gardening is to throw things into my the ground and see what I can keep alive.

A few years ago, a friend of mine mentioned using the [twelve permaculture principles](https://permacultureprinciples.com/) as a way to think about her life it got me thinking. Could I do that? What would it mean to think about the ecological system of my everyday life?\
\
This document was born and I'm currently working on expanding it as the winter approaches. I often like to use that time of year to evaluate the past year and consider what I want in the next year. This document is meant to help with that investigation by posing questions that help us think through permaculture principles in our everyday life. \
\
To my mind, these principles take seriously the fact that we as embedded in an ecosystem, and I find that way of thinking much more systemic and evocative.

## What does permaculture teach?

I find metaphors from nature to be powerfully motivating and helpful in my work even if I do not always manage to keep the bugs from eating holes in my kale.

When I think about the complexities of my life as an ecosystem, or a garden or a forest I gain so much more than if I think of lists of tasks, priorities or goals.

What follows are some musing about each of the twelve permaculture principles followed by questions you might consider and reflect on as you consider your own life.
