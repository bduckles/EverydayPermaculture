This principle in a food system is about harvesting food and energy sources when they are in abundance so that you can use them in times of need. In ecological terms, that typically refers to things like renewable energy systems (solar, wind, geothermal) or abundance in terms of saving crops or working with the sun.

For our personal daily lives however, this principle asks us to consider our own personal energy and how we are able to align that vitality and aliveness with the things we want to do in the world. What kinds of things renew us? What kind of energy can we store and use later on?

-   What time of day do I feel most alive? What am I typically doing during those times?

-   What activities and situations are energizing to me? Does being social energize me? Animals? Nature? Puzzles/Problem solving? Playing? Creating?

-   When have I felt calm, centered and awake in my life? What was happening that I felt that way?

-   When have I felt stressed, challenged and tired? What was happening that I felt that way?

-   What type of food nourishes and energizes me?

-   What type of people nourish and energizes me?
