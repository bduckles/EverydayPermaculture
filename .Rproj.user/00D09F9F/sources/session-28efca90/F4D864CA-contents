This principle suggests that what we grow and cultivate in our lives should offer us a yield or a benefit. I’ve heard for instance that some people who are devoted to permaculture will only grow things in their gardens that have multiple uses such as bamboo which offers a variety of yields: it creates shade, it’s a privacy fence, it stops water from flowing down a hill and it can be used to make things.

I find it compelling to think about what my work, time and energy has yielded. We may go to work so that we can get paid, but we may yield more than just money from that work. Perhaps we also get a sense of purpose, a community of like-minded individuals, a sense of well being and accomplishment. You might trade those things for less yields in other parts of your life such as free time or the capacity to travel. 

-   What is it that I have an easy time creating? What do I have a LOT of?

-   Of the things that I have a lot of, which of those things am I glad I have an abundance of?

-   Of the things that I have a lot of, what would I prefer to have less of?

-   What is it that I struggle to cultivate? What do I not have enough of?

-   What do I not cultivate that I’m glad to keep out of my life?
