I like to think of a “closed loop” system as like a dome on Mars or the Moon. Everything has to stay in the dome, which means that waste has to be dealt with. Waste has to offer something to the rest of the system otherwise we’ll have a dome overflowing with stuff we don’t want. This principle suggests that what we “waste” is something to value. Manure for instance is a remarkable fertilizer and serves a purpose in a garden. We wouldn’t call that waste even though it is excrement.

This principle seeks to question our modern concept of waste and to suggest that we see all that we create and produce as useful. When we look at our lives and what we spend our time, resources and energy doing things, where are we creating waste?

-   Where do I waste time? Where do I waste energy or effort? Where do I waste money?

-   What makes these actions wasteful? Am I sure it's wasteful and not yielding something I don’t like (such as weeds)?

-   What piles up in my life? What do I lose? What do I forget?

-   What in my life could be maintained and cared for with more attention? What would it look like to care for what I already have?
