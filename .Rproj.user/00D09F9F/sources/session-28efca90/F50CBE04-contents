The last principle reminds us that change is a constant and we are going to have to keep responding to an evolving world. Even if we are doing everything “right” there will always be things to adapt to.

There are places where we’re already changing.As we get older and our loved ones get older too. We can use this principle to cultivate a flexible and creative response to those changes. 

-   Where am I facing shifts and changes in my life? Where am I resistant to change? Where am I excited about change?

-   Where can I be more creative and intentional in the things that are shifting in my life? Where can I bring my skills, abilities and resources to bear on what is shifting?

-   In what circumstances is it easy for me to be flexible and to adapt to change? In what circumstances is it harder for me to be flexible and adapt to change?
