Diversity in an ecosystem is vital to ensuring that the system survives even if one crop is blighted or a natural event takes out a part of the system. 

In our lives, we may wish to spend some time considering where we are spending time doing the same things over and over again, where are we talking to the same kinds of people, or staying within one certain mindset? What can we do to value diverse perspectives in a variety of ways?

-   Where in my life am I able to listen to people who don’t agree with me?

-   When was the last time I talked to someone who was different from me? Grew up in another city? Has a different diet to mine? Looks different than me? Knows a language I don’t? Is at least 20 years older or 10 years younger than me? Likes to do things I don’t know how to do?

-   Where might I build in small diversities in my day such as taking a different route home or wearing different clothing or listening to someone I’ve never talked to before?
