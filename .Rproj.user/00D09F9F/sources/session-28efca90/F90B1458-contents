Consider what you see in the environment around you.

This principle is about really investigating and opening to our capacity to observe the world around us and to pay attention to what is true with compassion, honesty and as much clarity as we can muster. It asks us to watch what we do and how we interact with others without judgement. This calls us to investigate what actually occurs in our life instead of what we imagine should happen. 

-   What parts of my life are really working for me right now? What parts are not working well?

-   What do I do without thinking about it? What do I do that seems difficult or challenging?

-   Where do things pile up in my space? Where do things stay clean?

-   When do I feel emotions that I don’t enjoy? When do I feel enjoyable emotions in my life? What time of day? What is happening when I feel those things?
