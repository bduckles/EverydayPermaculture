### Use Natural Patterns and Apply them to Design

This principle asks us to use nature as our teacher and to consider the patterns we see repeated in natural systems as ways to rethink the life we lead. This might lead us to consider how can we learn from the patterns in nature and apply them to the problems we face.

-   What metaphors and processes in the natural world are interesting to me? Do I feel drawn to an action a certain animal makes? The way that a tree interacts in the woods? A flower, shrub or herb? What is it about these natural elements that appeal to me? What does it teach me?

-   Does nature deal with some version of a problem or a challenge I face? If so, how does the natural world respond?

-   Consider the four elements â€” earth, water, wind and fire. Which of these is most resonant in my life right now? What might that element teach me?
