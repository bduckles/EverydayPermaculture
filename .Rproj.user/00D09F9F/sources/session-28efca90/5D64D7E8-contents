### Capitalize on the way that things work together

A permaculture practitioner would look at more than an individual plant, but they'd try to understand it in relationship to the other plants around it and how they work best together. They'd try to understand the whole as more than the sum of its parts. 

We’re social creatures. We exist in community with one another and with our society. This principle asks us to look at our relationships and the connections we could build.

-   Where can I offer the excesses and abundance I have to those who need it? Where can others offer me their excess and abundance where I need it?

-   What collaborations might I create or join?

-   Are there other groups that could benefit from a relationship with me and my life?

-   Who or what else is doing something that is similar to the things I do? Who else has the same problems I do?
